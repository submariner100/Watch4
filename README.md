# Watch4
A currency convertor for the Apple Watch.
Lessons cover in this module - I be using Page interfaces, Slider controls and Picker controls. I also be using GCD good practices,
to recieve JSON data from a server. Custom classes are used. Static arrays and UIColor will all be used in this project. 
The user will be able to convert any number of currencies he wants on his apple watch and received real time results instantly.
Website used to connect currencies was https://fixer.io/api.
